## External Script Usage

This plugin includes JavaScript files that are built using Angular. The source files, excluding proprietary code, are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ahsanampacash/ampa-cash-veprap). 

### Source Code

- Source code for `veprap.js` can be found in the `src/` directory of the GitHub repository.
- Unminified versions of `intlTelInput.js` and other libraries are also included in the `src/` directory.

The compressed file `ampacash-veprap-payment/js/veprap.js` is generated by building the public Angular project following the instructions in the readme file on GitHub. This generates a standalone file of the entire Angular project.

### Build Instructions

To build the JavaScript files from source, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ahsanampacash/ampa-cash-veprap.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ampa-cash-veprap`
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to install dependencies and build the project.

### Local Files
The plugin now includes all required scripts and styles locally:
- `ampacash-veprap-payment/js/intlTelInput.js`
- `ampacash-veprap-payment/js/veprap.js`
